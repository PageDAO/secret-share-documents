## About The Project

Secret Network is introducing a groundbreaking functionality to utilize its blockchain as a service. This innovation offers new possibilities, such as the ability to execute contracts on Polygon while leveraging the privacy features of Secret Network. This approach ensures the security of a primary blockchain while harnessing the privacy capabilities of Secret Network for external computations.

We aimed to create a robust mechanism for securely sharing documents on the blockchain with specific recipients. This solution addresses a critical need for businesses and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) seeking to share sensitive administrative and confidential data to a selected audience. Currently, the challenge lies in sharing documents on-chain while safeguarding the privacy of users. We firmly believe that Secret Network's cutting-edge technology can effectively address this use case by enabling individuals to share documents with the assurance of privacy and data encryption, thus redefining the way confidential information is shared within a blockchain ecosystem.

Through this project, we are providing a SDK allowing anyone to store and share confidential documents by taking advantage of the Secret Network chain while remaining on an EVM chain.  

## Getting Started

This project is decomposed in sevaral components:

- `contract`: The Secret Network smart contract, that will be deploy on the Secret Network chain, allowing user to store confidential data.
- `polygon-secret`: The EVM implementation to send a message to Axelar GMP.
- `sdk-js`: The SDK implementation, allowing you to interact with all the component.
- `front`: An example use case to store confidential document.
